The programs in this package were built using the XDS Modula-2 compiler,
but they should compile with any Modula-2 compiler compatible with the
current language standard.  The project options are specified in
the included files *.prj.  See also the file makezip.cmd, which
is the batch file that was used to generate the zip file that you
received when you obtained this program.  The line in makezip.cmd
that says
      xc =p ftpd.prj
is the command that compiles and links all the modules for FTPD.EXE;
and similarly for the other programs.

Note that makezip.cmd is included for information only. It will not
work for you "as is", because you probably don't have the same
directory layout as the machine on which this zip file was created.

The required files SO32DLL.LIB and TCP32DLL.LIB can be found in
the OS2TK45 directory of most eCS installations.  If you don't have that
directory, search for the OS/2 development toolkit on the usual OS/2
software sites.

The IMPORTS program that is referred to in makezip.cmd is not needed
to make this program, only to zip up the sources.  If you want a copy,
it can be found at the same place you downloaded this package.

The makezip.cmd also invokes a program called LxLite. This is a utility,
available on the usual OS/2 archive sites, that reduces the size of
EXE files (and some others) by removing non-essential information.
Its use is optional.

The script also invokes Perl, but only to create symbol files for
debugging purposes, so it too is optional.
